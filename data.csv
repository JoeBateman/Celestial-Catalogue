Nebula,HII region,Orion,4,1.27E+16,3.98E+33,354.538,5.631,Orion is one of the brightest nebulae and is visible to the naked eye. It is a small part of the much larger Orion molecular cloud complex which covers the constellation of Orion and the Horsehead nebula.,,,
Nebula,Planetary,Glowing Eye,11.9,6.17E+16,1.99E+31,353.925,19.237,The glowing eye is named for its disinct halos and bright central bubble. ,,,
Nebula,Supernova remnant,Cassiopeia A,6,1.05E+17,1.99E+31,58.815,23.45,"Cassiopeia A may first have been observed in 1680 when it was noted as a star by Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed. The rate of expansion is 4000-6000 km/s but some outlying ""knots"" appear to being traveling at as much as 14500 km/s.",,,
Planet,Super-Earth,Barnards Star b,30,5.68E+13,1.93E+25,4.783,17.963,The discovery of Barnard's Star b was declared in 2018 and is the first planet discovered in its system. Later data contradicts this claim as the radial velocity signal does not appear in subsequent datasets.,0,0,
Planet,Giant,Saturn,0.575,1.51E+09,5.68E+26,12.615,2.585,The moon Titan is in fact larger than the Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system known to have a substantial atmosphere.,82,7,
Planet,Mesoplanet,Pluto,15.1,5.13E+09,1.31E+22,348.607,16.76,The only spacecraft to reach pluto is New Horizons in 2015 and allowed for detailed measurements and photos to be taken for the first time. The north cap was subsequently noted to be composed of organic macromolecules that may allow for the emergence of life.,5,0,
Planet,Super-Jupiter,Kappa Andromedae b,14.37,1.59E+15,2.58E+28,44.338,23.733,Kappa Andromedae b was first detected in 2012 by direct imaging methods. So far it is the only known planet in the system.,0,0,
Planet,Sub-Earth,Mars,0.71,2.47E+08,6.39E+23,346.677,22.0094,The first spacecraft to reach Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965 and is currently home to 14 still functioning craft. Astronomy on Mars can also be done due to the large prescence of missions now made to the planet. ,2,0,
Planet,Ice giant,Neptune,7.835,4.58E+09,1.02E+26,340.783,20.3608,Neptune is the planet farthest from the center of the solar system and due to its composition of liquid and gas it has no clearly defined surface.,14,5,
Star,White dwarf,Sirius B,8.44,8.15E+13,2.03E+30,343.283,6.775,Sirius b's binary partner (Sirius A) is the brightest star in the night sky. The discovery of Sirius b was made in 1844  when observations of Sirius A's proper motion were made that indicated there was a presently unseen companion. Sirius b is nicknamed the pup (following in Sirius A'scolloquial name the dog star ).,0.056,D,
Star,Main sequence,Sol,-26.74,1.39E+06,1.99E+30,359.75,23.96,The formation of the sun 4.6 billion years ago is likely from shockwaves of supernovae (as evidenced by  the high abundance of heavy elements in the star and system). Sol draws its name from the personification of the Sun in Roman mythology.,1,G,
Star,Red dwarf,Proxima Centauri,11.05,4.02E+13,2.49E+29,297.333,14.6,Proxima Centauri is generally too dim to be observed by the naked eye. It is also a flare star meaning that it may undergo a huge increase in brightness apparently randomly.,0.0017,M,
Star,Neutron star,Centaurus X-3,13.25,1.76E+17,4.08E+31,299.383,11.391,Centaurus X-3 is an X-ray pulsar in a binary system with an O-type supergiant. X-ray emission is fueled by the accretion of matter from the supergiant to the neutron star.,316000,O,
Star,Red giant,Aldebaran,0.75,6.15E+14,2.31E+30,16.509,4.5925,,439,K,
Star,Blue giant,Bellatrix,1.64,2.37E+15,1.53E+31,6.349,5.432,Bellatrix is the brightest star in the constellation of Orion. It also has a slightly variable magnitude which is possibly due to its slow rotation.,9211,B,
Star,Supergiant,Rigel,0.13,8.17E+15,4.18E+31,351.798,5.242,Rigel is and a nearby 3-star system orbit around a common center of gravity (with a period of around 24000 years). Due to solar winds Rigel loses 10 million times as much matter per second as the sun and is expected to end its life by a Type II supernova to a neutron star or black hole. ,120000,B,
